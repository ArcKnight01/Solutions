  2. How to calculate
  
Power Budget
  1. No sun tracking
    a. 15 hour day in the sun + 9 in the dark
      i. about 180deg/15hr angular velocity of sun in sky 
      ii. no power in the dark
      iii. power in the light - 2* integrate power vs time (from angle) = XXX Wh
    b. battery is full - start with 10Ah at 5V = 50Wh
    c. run things
      i. flatsat 3 hours = XXX Wh (Pi 3) and XXX Wh (Pi 4)
      ii. stressberry 3 hours = XXX Wh (Pi 3) and XXX Wh (Pi 4)
      iii. idle for 18 hours = XXX Wh (Pi 3) and XXX Wh (Pi 4)
    d. sustainable? how many Wh left in battery
      i. Pi 3 - 
      ii. Pi 4 - 
  2. With sun tracking
    a. 15 hour day in the sun + 9 in the dark
      i. about 180deg/15hr angular velocity of sun in sky 
      ii. no power in the dark
      iii. power in the light - max power * day length = XXX Wh
    b. battery is full - start with 10Ah at 5V = 50Wh
    c. run things
      i. flatsat 3 hours = XXX Wh (Pi 3) and XXX Wh (Pi 4)
      ii. stressberry 3 hours = XXX Wh (Pi 3) and XXX Wh (Pi 4)
      iii. idle for 18 hours = XXX Wh (Pi 3) and XXX Wh (Pi 4)
    d. sustainable? how many Wh left in battery
      i. Pi 3 - 
      ii. Pi 4 -
